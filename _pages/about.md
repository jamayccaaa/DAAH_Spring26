Over the past few years, my journey in the digital humanities has been both exciting and transformative. As someone who is passionate about the intersection of technology and the humanities, I have developed a range of digital skills that have allowed me to explore, analyze, and present humanistic questions in new and innovative ways. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the vast landscape that remains to be explored, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.

**What I Know How to Do Digitally**

My digital skillset has grown steadily through coursework, independent projects, and collaborative experiences. One of my foundational skills is proficiency in digital text analysis. I am comfortable using tools such as Voyant Tools and AntConc to perform basic text mining, word frequency analysis, and topic modeling. These tools have enabled me to uncover patterns and themes in large corpora that would be difficult to detect through traditional close reading alone. For example, I have used Voyant Tools to analyze the language of 19th-century novels, revealing shifts in sentiment and recurring motifs across different authors and time periods.

In addition to text analysis, I have gained experience in data visualization. I can use platforms like Tableau and RAWGraphs to create compelling visual representations of data, such as timelines, network graphs, and heat maps. These visualizations have helped me communicate complex findings to a broader audience, making abstract concepts more tangible and accessible. I have also experimented with mapping tools like Google My Maps and StoryMapJS to create interactive maps that trace the movements of historical figures or plot the locations of significant events.

Another area where I feel confident is digital publishing. I have built and maintained simple websites using platforms like WordPress and Jekyll, allowing me to share my research and reflections with a wider community. I understand the basics of HTML and CSS, which has given me the flexibility to customize site layouts and improve user experience. Through these projects, I have learned the importance of accessibility and usability in digital scholarship.

Collaboration is a key aspect of digital humanities, and I have developed skills in using collaborative tools such as GitHub for version control and project management. Working with others on digital projects has taught me how to coordinate tasks, track changes, and document workflows effectively. I have also participated in online forums and communities, where I have learned from others’ experiences and contributed my own insights.

**What There Is Left to Learn**

Despite these accomplishments, I recognize that digital humanities is a rapidly evolving field with much more to offer. One area I am eager to explore further is computational methods for humanities research. While I have dabbled in Python for basic data manipulation, I want to deepen my understanding of programming so that I can write custom scripts for more advanced text analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. Learning languages like Python and R would open up new possibilities for automating tasks and handling larger datasets.

I am also interested in learning more about digital archives and metadata. Understanding how digital collections are curated, described, and preserved is crucial for ensuring the longevity and accessibility of cultural heritage materials. I would like to gain hands-on experience with tools like Omeka and CONTENTdm, as well as learn about metadata standards such as Dublin Core and TEI. This knowledge would enable me to contribute to the creation and maintenance of digital archives that serve both scholarly and public audiences.

Another area for growth is critical engagement with digital tools and methods. As digital humanities scholars, it is important not only to use technology but also to reflect on its implications. I want to learn more about the ethical considerations involved in digital research, such as issues of privacy, representation, and bias. Engaging with scholarship on digital ethics and participating in discussions about best practices will help me become a more responsible and thoughtful practitioner.

Finally, I am excited to explore emerging technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality, and virtual reality. These tools have the potential to transform how we interact with historical materials and tell stories about the past. I am particularly interested in how immersive experiences can be used to engage new audiences and foster empathy and understanding.

**Conclusion**

In summary, my journey in digital humanities has equipped me with valuable skills in text analysis, data visualization, digital publishing, and collaboration. However, I am aware that there is always more to learn. By deepening my technical expertise, engaging critically with digital methods, and exploring new technologies, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the field and continue to grow as a digital humanist. The possibilities are vast, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me next.
