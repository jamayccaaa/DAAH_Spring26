<h1> Claude </h1>

Over the past few years, my journey in the digital humanities has been both exciting and transformative. As someone who is passionate about the intersection of technology and the humanities, I have developed a range of digital skills that have allowed me to explore, analyze, and present humanistic questions in new and innovative ways. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the vast landscape that remains to be explored, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.

**What I Know How to Do Digitally**

My digital skillset has grown steadily through coursework, independent projects, and collaborative experiences. One of my foundational skills is proficiency in digital text analysis. I am comfortable using tools such as Voyant Tools and AntConc to perform basic text mining, word frequency analysis, and topic modeling. These tools have enabled me to uncover patterns and themes in large corpora that would be difficult to detect through traditional close reading alone. For example, I have used Voyant Tools to analyze the language of 19th-century novels, revealing shifts in sentiment and recurring motifs across different authors and time periods.

In addition to text analysis, I have gained experience in data visualization. I can use platforms like Tableau and RAWGraphs to create compelling visual representations of data, such as timelines, network graphs, and heat maps. These visualizations have helped me communicate complex findings to a broader audience, making abstract concepts more tangible and accessible. I have also experimented with mapping tools like Google My Maps and StoryMapJS to create interactive maps that trace the movements of historical figures or plot the locations of significant events.

Another area where I feel confident is digital publishing. I have built and maintained simple websites using platforms like WordPress and Jekyll, allowing me to share my research and reflections with a wider community. I understand the basics of HTML and CSS, which has given me the flexibility to customize site layouts and improve user experience. Through these projects, I have learned the importance of accessibility and usability in digital scholarship.

Collaboration is a key aspect of digital humanities, and I have developed skills in using collaborative tools such as GitHub for version control and project management. Working with others on digital projects has taught me how to coordinate tasks, track changes, and document workflows effectively. I have also participated in online forums and communities, where I have learned from others’ experiences and contributed my own insights.

**What There Is Left to Learn**

Despite these accomplishments, I recognize that digital humanities is a rapidly evolving field with much more to offer. One area I am eager to explore further is computational methods for humanities research. While I have dabbled in Python for basic data manipulation, I want to deepen my understanding of programming so that I can write custom scripts for more advanced text analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. Learning languages like Python and R would open up new possibilities for automating tasks and handling larger datasets.

I am also interested in learning more about digital archives and metadata. Understanding how digital collections are curated, described, and preserved is crucial for ensuring the longevity and accessibility of cultural heritage materials. I would like to gain hands-on experience with tools like Omeka and CONTENTdm, as well as learn about metadata standards such as Dublin Core and TEI. This knowledge would enable me to contribute to the creation and maintenance of digital archives that serve both scholarly and public audiences.

Another area for growth is critical engagement with digital tools and methods. As digital humanities scholars, it is important not only to use technology but also to reflect on its implications. I want to learn more about the ethical considerations involved in digital research, such as issues of privacy, representation, and bias. Engaging with scholarship on digital ethics and participating in discussions about best practices will help me become a more responsible and thoughtful practitioner.

Finally, I am excited to explore emerging technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality, and virtual reality. These tools have the potential to transform how we interact with historical materials and tell stories about the past. I am particularly interested in how immersive experiences can be used to engage new audiences and foster empathy and understanding.

**Reflection on Digital Literacy: A 20-Year-Old’s Perspective**

As a 20-year-old university student double majoring in Art and Art History and Interactive Media, digital literacy is not just a skillset—it’s a daily necessity and a lens through which I interpret both my academic and personal worlds. Navigating between creative expression and technological fluency, I find myself constantly adapting to new platforms, tools, and collaborative environments. My journey in digital literacy is shaped by the unique intersection of my majors, but also by the diverse skills and perspectives of my peers from fields as varied as Computer Science, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Engineering, and Literature.

**Strategies and Tools for Content Creation and Social Interaction**

In my daily life, content creation is second nature. I use Adobe Creative Suite—especially Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro—for everything from designing posters for campus events to editing short films for class projects. For interactive assignments, I rely on platforms like Figma for prototyping and Unity for building simple digital experiences. Social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok are not just for personal expression but also serve as spaces to share my art, connect with other creatives, and even participate in digital art challenges that push my skills further.

Collaboration is a core part of my academic experience. Google Workspace tools (Docs, Slides, Drive) are essential for group projects, allowing real-time editing and seamless communication. For more complex collaborations, especially in Interactive Media, I use GitHub to manage code and version control, even if my coding skills are still developing. Discord and Slack channels keep me connected with classmates, enabling quick feedback and fostering a sense of community beyond the classroom.

**Research, Data Management, and Analysis**

Research in Art History often means managing large sets of images, bibliographies, and notes. I use Zotero for reference management and Evernote for organizing research materials. For data manipulation and analysis, especially in Interactive Media, I am learning to use Python (with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib) to analyze datasets—whether it’s tracking trends in digital art or visualizing user engagement in interactive installations. Tableau and RAWGraphs help me turn raw data into compelling visual stories, making complex information accessible and engaging.

**Interdisciplinary Skills and the Digital Humanities Horizon**

Being surrounded by students from different disciplines has broadened my understanding of what digital literacy can mean. Computer Science majors bring algorithmic thinking and programming expertise, while Film and New Media students excel at storytelling and visual communication. Environmental Studies peers introduce me to GIS mapping and data visualization for sustainability projects, and those in Literature or Creative Writing inspire me to think about narrative structure and digital publishing.

Digital humanities, as I am discovering, offers a bridge between these worlds. It encourages us to use computational tools to ask new questions about culture, history, and society. For example, text mining techniques can reveal hidden patterns in historical documents, while digital mapping can trace the movement of artistic styles across regions and eras. The collaborative nature of digital humanities projects means I am constantly learning from others—whether it’s debugging code with an Engineering major or designing a website with a Film student.

**Developing Computational Thinking and Embracing AI**

Collaboration has been key to developing my computational thinking. Working on interdisciplinary teams, I’ve learned to break down complex problems, iterate on solutions, and appreciate the value of diverse perspectives. Exposure to AI tools—like ChatGPT for brainstorming or DALL-E for generating visual concepts—has opened my eyes to new creative possibilities, but also raised important questions about authorship, bias, and the ethical use of technology.

**Critical Reflection and Aspirations**

While I am comfortable with many digital tools, I recognize that my technical skills—especially in coding and data analysis—are still emerging. This course has challenged me to move beyond surface-level familiarity and engage more deeply with the logic behind the tools I use. I am learning to think critically about data: Where does it come from? How is it structured? What stories can it tell, and what might it obscure?

I am also discovering the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in digital projects. As I design digital experiences, I want to ensure they are usable by people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. This means learning more about web accessibility standards and ethical design principles.

Looking ahead, I am excited to explore new ways of thinking—especially around the integration of AI and machine learning in the arts and humanities. I want to experiment with generative art, natural language processing, and immersive technologies like AR and VR. Most importantly, I hope to continue collaborating across disciplines, learning from my peers, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what digital humanities can be.
